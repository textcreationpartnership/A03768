            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

fyrſt ſkyrmiſhyng was for hys bely ſake, which he made a god of. the which thing he him ſelf could not kepe cloſe.

It is well inoughe knowen, that at the begynnyng Luther was not ſo

In a certayne epiſtle wrytten to Pope Leo, there are theſe wordes to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, which he wrote aboue eight and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeares a gone: Moſte blyſſed father,<note place="margin">Luther his ſubmiſſion to the Pope</note> I offer my ſelffe flatt vpon the grounde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore youre holy fere, with all that I am worthe.

            <p>Doth not he here playnely confeſſe, that by beatyng this newe fownde doctrine in to the peoples heades, he intended not to further the glory of Chriſt, to ſet abrode y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledge of his truthe: but that as he hym ſelff was blynded with the myſt of malice againſt the Pope, ſo he myght ſett the hartes of other men a fyar with the ſame hatred?

            <p>For ſo muche then as in all his ſayin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, writinges, doinges,<note place="margin">Luter was lod with a dyuelliſhe ſpyrit, to do moſte of thoſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which he dyd.</note> he vſed none but of all other the moſt perniciouſe councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loures, that is angre &amp; hatred, is there any which as yet will doubt, that thoſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which proceded from him, haue bene deryued from any other then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very diuel: If there be any ſuche doubter, let Luther hym ſelf dryue away that doubt, who in a

Whoſe voyce alſo he there deſcribeth to be a bygg, baſe, and boyſterouſe voyce, and which dothe make ſo terrible a noyſe, that it chaunſeth often after conference had with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Dyuell by nyght, that men be found dead y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> next day in the mornyng. For the Dyuell, ſayth he, can kyll the body, beſyde that he ſmy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ſuche a feare in to the mynde, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſome tyme in the twynklyng of an eye, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forſed to depart oute of the body.

of Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as he hymſelff confeſſeth, which firſt dyd ſet it abroche.

            <p>Thus youre Maieſtie vnderſtandeth, from whens this is fetcht,<note place="margin">Why Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his lo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re can not be allowed</note> which ſome na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me the Goſpell and the ſyncere worde of God, yea and that by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> owne confeſſyon of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> author hym ſelff, who, as Chriſt once ſayde,<note place="margin">

Thoughe Luther hym ſelff ſholde deny this, yet wolde the thyng it ſelffe be a ſufficient profe, that it is the Dyuelles worde, and not the worde of God, which he dyd firſt blaſe abroade in this oure age.

Thus Luther and Carolſtadius dyd burne with deadly diſpleaſure one againſt the other, they dyd rayle ſo ſpytefully one againſt the other, that they ſemed wurſe then heretikes one to the other.

            <p>Nowe as touching the Sacramentaries, Martyn Luther dothe gyue thys verdict of them: In good erneſt we gyue ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that all Zwinglians and Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taries be heretykes, &amp; none of Chriſt his church, becauſe they ſay, that the body and blood of Chriſt is not receaued with the carnall mouthe in the honorable Sacrament.</p>

for ſo muche as euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the begynnyng, ſo farr as there is anie Chriſtian grown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, there hathe bene one vniforme belefe of all men, concernyng thys Sacrament. Therefore (ſayth he) if any man do nowe doubt of it, he dothe as thoughe he bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not one, holy, and catholyke churche. Who alſo ſemeth not onlye to condemne all the whole Churche of hereſye, but alſo Chriſt hym ſelff with his Apoſtles &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, with whoſe moſte reuerend teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony this article is confirmed, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which we do profeſſe, that we beleue the holy ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholyke churche.

Moreouer, theyre owne opinion beareth wytneſſe agaynſt them, for ſo muche as in the expoſition of thys text they ſo iarr and diſagree, that a man may fynde almoſt ſeuen or eyght in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations. Here Martyn Luther pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced a moſte true ſentence, makynge no more agaynſt the Zuinglians, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſte hym ſelffe, and hys owne broo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, which ſcamble by the cares no leſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them ſelues, and ſet no leſſe by the conſent of the Churche then they doo. He
<pb facs="tcp:13954:39"/>
goeth on wryting to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forſayde duke, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thys manner: Wherefore I aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe and beſeche youre grace, that you will auoyde ſuche men, &amp; ſuffer them not with in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> precinct of youre iuriſdiction: for this you muſt nedes aſſure youre ſelffe, that if you graunt ſuche ſowers of ſectes anye quiet abyding in youre territories, when you may be rydde of them, it ſhall be an heauy burden to youre conſcience, &amp; you ſhall ſcantly be able euer hereafter to pull oute the worme which continually ſhall gnawe it. Thus dyd Luther warne hys adherentes to graunt no intertaynement to the Sacramentaries, whome he boldly dyd affirme to be miniſters of Sathan, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, yea very lying it ſelf, hypocriſie, and ſimulation. And in that booke which he intituled <hi>De coena Chriſti,</hi> of the ſupper of Chriſt, he biddeth all men beware of Zuin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>glius, as of the poyſon of Sathan. This is Luthers cenſure or verdict vppon the Sacramentaries.</p>

God in dede, as the common trade of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retykes is, who all will ſeme to haue the ſtaffe of God hys worde to leane vpon.</p>
            <p>Bucer alſo wryteth, that euery man ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ill of Luther for hys comptrolyng &amp; ſnappiſhe kynde of wryting,<note place="margin">In his Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon.</note> and for that he can not abyde that any man ſholde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

In tranſlatyng and expoundyng the ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, he hathe committed very groſſe faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, &amp; that not in a fewe places. Thus you ſee, that the Zuinglians thought it to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them as well to ſwarue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Luther, as it dyd Luther to differ from the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall churche. In lyke manner the miniſters of Surk makyng anſwer to a boke, which Luther a lyttell before he dyed, had ſet oute agaynſt the Zuinglians, inveyhing byt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly agaynſt them, among other thinges ſpeake in this wyſe: The Prophetes and Apoſtles had alwayes regarde to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, not to theyre owne priuat pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, not to theyre owne ſelffe wyll &amp; prowde conceite, but they only dyd ſeke the ſoule healthe of ſynners: but Luther ſeketh hys owne profyt, he is ſtyff necked,
<pb facs="tcp:13954:40"/>
he is puffed vpp with pryde, he ſtrayght way gyueth them ouer to the Dyuell, as many as at a beck will not ſubſcribe to his opinion: and in all his reformations there appeare many tokens of a malitiouſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryt, but not one ſparck of a frendly or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly affection. Lo, this is the iudgement of the Sacramentaries vpon Luther &amp; his followers, &amp; agayne the verdict of Luther concerning the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taries. And it is not to be doubted, but bothe verdictes be true, ſince bothe parties came forthe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ſcole, and were thaught of one ſcole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter the Dyuell. Some there be which reporte abroade, that an agreable confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was made betwene the Zuinglians &amp; the Lutherans, concerning the ſacrament of the altar. But leſt any man ſholde be deceaued with this falſe rumor, I think it good to folde vpp in a fewe wordes, what I knowe certaynly of this matter. I haue already opened, what heauyng &amp; ſhoueing was betwene Luther, who affirmed the breade to be the body of Chriſt ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and really, and Oecolampadius and Zuinglius, which ſayde, that it was but a ſigne &amp; bare figure only. The which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention ſo ſone as it bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be made hotte,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:13954:40"/>
in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuaunce of tyme, it grewe to ſuche a greate flame, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they toſſed the fyar bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of this controuerſie one at an others heade, aboute the ſpace of fyften yeares, becauſe (as Calvyn wryteth) they coulde not abyde to heare one an other quietlye to ſpeake theyre myndes: For (ſayth he) althoughe they met once together to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſe thys matter, yet they ſo helde one an other at the ſtaffes end, that they brake of, and left the matter in as euell a pyckell as they founde it. So that when they ſholde haue come to ſome agrement, they ſhron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke backward more and more, myndyng no thing elles, then to mayntayne theyre ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne opynion, and to comptroll and confute them, whiche ſayde the contrarye. When Caluin ſpyed that,<note place="margin">Caluin ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon hym to be a iudge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the Lutherans &amp; the Zuin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>glia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vpp an hereſie ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of before.</note> he toke vpon him to be iudge betwene them bothe, as Muncerus intermedled hym ſelffe betwene the Pope and Luther, &amp; condemnyng as well Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius and Oecolampadius hys opinyon, as Luthers, brought in a newe hereſye, neuer heard of before, not only vnknowen to the auncient Fathers and Doctours, but alſo ſtraunge to the late vppſtart dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelliſhe proctoures the Sacramentaries.</p>
            <p>For he taught, that breade and wyne vſed

With which doing beſyde of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending of Luther, he gat greate diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the ſcole of Tigurine: the whiche ſcole, for ſo muche as it dothe reuercene Vlryke Zuinglius, as the fyrſt founder of theyre doctryne, coulde not abyde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyne ſholde fynde faulte with hym, &amp; with out any warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of ſcripture forge a newe fangled opynion of the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: Caluyn afterward glad and fayne to quenche this hott diſpleaſure kyndled againſt hym, dyd wryght an Epiſtle, in which he labored to ſhewe, that he dyd not ſwarue from Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius and others his good maſters of that ſcole, in the doctryne of the ſupper of ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Lorde, whereas in very dede he varyed greatly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them.<note place="margin">Caluin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            </p>
            <p>But I think it good here to recite, what the Fathers aſſembled at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> generall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Trent, haue determined vpon this matter. Theſe be theire wordes: Although it be neceſſary to beleue, that ſynnes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be forgyue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nether euer were releaſed but frely by the mercye of God for Chriſt his ſake, yet muſt not we ſaye, that he is quyted of hys ſynnes, which maketh hys boaſte, &amp; only leaueth on the certayne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of forgiuenes of hys ſynnes, ſeyng bothe of the heritykes, &amp; alſo the ſciſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tykes, this vayne &amp; deteſtable confydence may be holden hereafter, and at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent day is mayntayned &amp; preached moſte erneſtly, contrary to the faythe &amp; doctryne of the Catholyke churche. Nether is this to be affirmed, that they which be truly iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, ought withoute all doubt to make
<pb facs="tcp:13954:60"/>
theire accompt that they be made perfect, and none other to be abſolued from hys ſynnes, and to be iuſtified, but hym which certaynly doth beleue, that he his aſſoyled and made ryghteouſe: and that this onlye faythe is cauſe of his abſolution and iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: as thoughe that he which dothe not beleue this, did doubt of God his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, of the vertue of Chriſt his deathe &amp; reſurrection. For as no good man ought to doubt of God hys mercy, of Chriſt hys merytes, of the vertue and poure of the Sacramentes, ſo euery man whileſt he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſydereth hym ſelffe, weygheth hys owne weakenes and vnaptnes, may well feare that he is not in God his fauoure: Seing no man can knowe with ſuche certaynete of faythe as may not be deceaued, whether he haue obtayned the fauoure of God. The holy Fathers do not here exclude eue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry kynde of certaynte,<note place="margin">An explica<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of the wordes of the Synode</note> but the certaynete of that fayth only which can not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued. With ſuche certaynte they deny y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any man can knowe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is in the fauoure of God. But that a man may knowe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a morall and probable certaynete, or by godly reuelation, as we veryly beleue that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bleſſed virgyn Mary, and the Apoſtles
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:13954:60"/>
dyd, they make no controuerſye at all.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, the Fathers here do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund vs to doubt, as the aduerſaries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye them, but they ſay that euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when he loketh back to hym ſelffe, to hys owne fraylete and vnfytnes, may feare that he is not in God his fauoure, and yet for all that be neuer the farther of from God his fauoure, althoughe he be not voyde of all feare for his ſyn, which God hathe veryly forgyuen. I thought it good to ſpeake more at large of this poynte, becauſe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſte ſynode I heard ſay, that certayne not vnderſtanding the matter throuly,<note place="margin">The arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaine.</note> founde greate fault with the article of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Doctors of Louayne, whiche is as followeth: The faythe with the which any man doth ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtlie beleue, and vndoubtedlie holde, that his ſynnes be forgiuen for Chriſt his ſake, and that he ſhall poſſeſſe euerlaſting lyfe, hathe no wytneſſe or warrant of the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, but is cleane contrary to them. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe we ought with certayne &amp; ſure hope, by meanes of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme and penaunce, loke for in this lyfe truly remiſſion of ſynnes, &amp; in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlde to come lyfe euerlaſting.

               </note> For what ſo euer is true, that is one: but what ſo euer is a lye, that is manyfolde and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe. Before whome alſo Athanaſius:

But they which be not of this mynde, are rather to be called wicked wretches, then true teachers and doctoures.

interprete not the wordes of Chriſt after the ſame ſorte, yet they agree all in this poynte, that they wyckedly deny the body and blood of Chriſt to be preſent in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.

            <p>You ſee, what authoritye Flaccus taketh vpon him, which feareth not to pronunce all the Vniuerſitie of Wittenberge (oute of the which came the ſame Martyn Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whome he maketh a God of) accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, &amp; to forbyd all good men to haue any thing to do with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vniuerſitie.

So it cam to paſſe, that when Luther had pearſed thoſe bankes which were caſt vpp to kepe oute the rage of the floodes, the mayne ſtrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of the waters dyd beate downe the bankes, ouerflowed and drowned farr &amp; neare the feldes, corne, and villages.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:13954:83"/>
which he thinketh to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> opinion of free wyll, of the which he euer taught,<note place="margin">Luther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth free will.</note> that it only ſuffereth, and neuer dothe any thing, that it is a thing of a bare name, or ells a fayned matter in thinges, or a title with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute a thing, becauſe it is in no man hys powre, to thinck either good or euell, but as Wycliff his article condemned at Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtance teacheth, all thinges come to paſſe of neceſſitie. So it is no doubt (ſayth he) this name free wyll, to haue come in to the churche from the Maſter thereof Sathan, to ſeduce men from the way of God in to theire owne wayes: &amp; euell workes (ſayth he) God worketh in the euell men.

For he durſt take vpon hym to gyue hys cenſure vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the holy Doctoures. Auguſtine, ſayth he, and Bernard, dyd wryte of free wyll, &amp; Auguſtine truly dyd recant diuerſe tymes in his laſt bokes written agaynſt the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians, his opinion of free wyll. As for Bernard, often tyme he turneth the cat in
<pb facs="tcp:13954:84"/>
the pan. The Greke Doctoures dyd wryte ſomthing of this matter, but oute of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. I, for ſo muche as I followe not the opinions of men, I wyll declare the whole matter moſte ſimply and playnely, which bothe olde and newe wryters haue darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, becauſe they dyd ſo interprete the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, as thoughe alſo they wolde ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of man his reaſon. They thought that it was agaynſt all polityke gouernement, to teache y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a man dyd ſynn of neceſſitie: they thought it a cruell thing to fynde fault w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> man hys wyll, if it could not turne it ſelffe from ſynne to vertue.</p>
            <p>Therefore they attributed more to man his ſtrengthe then they ought to haue do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and they dyd meruaylouſly diſagree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them ſelues, for ſo much as they dyd ſee that in euery place it was contrary to the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of reaſon: and truly in this place, where as Chriſtian doctrine diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth muche from Philoſophy and man his reaſon, yet Philoſophy by lyttell and lyttell crept in to Chriſtian doctryne, and this wycked opinion of free wyll is recea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued, the goodnes of Chriſt is darckned by oure prophane and carnall wyſdome. The worde of free wyll is vſurped moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:13954:84"/>
to the holy ſcripture, to the meaning and iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the holy ghoſte, with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which we ſee holy men haue bene ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diſpleaſed. There is added alſo oute of Plato his phi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>loſophie this worde of reaſon, which is as pernitiouſe and daungerouſe as the other. For lyke as in theſe laſte tymes we haue embraſed Ariſtotle in ſteade of Chriſt, ſo euen immediatly after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fyrſt begynnyng of the Churche, Chriſtian doctryne was corrupted with Platos philoſophye: ſo is it brought to paſſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there be no ſyncere &amp; pure bokes in the Church, beſyde the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall ſcripture. All the commentaries, which learned men haue wrytten, ſmell of Philoſophy. And with in a lyttel whyle after, dothe any man aſke me, if there be any free wyll? I aunſwer, becauſe all thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges whiche come to paſſe, do neceſſarilye come to paſſe according to the predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, there is no libertie or freedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of oure wyl. What the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you wyl ſay, is there in thinges (y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I may vſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Papiſtes wordes) no caſualtye? no chaunce? no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune?

Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kius ſayth, that Valla wolde knowe more then euer he had learned, becauſe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
<pb facs="tcp:13954:85"/>
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcole mennes opinion of free wyll. And in the end, gathering a ſum of all his ſaynges, he ſaythe: If you refer man his wyll to the predeſtination of God, there is no libertie ether in outeward or inward workes. But all thinges come to paſſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the predeſtination of God. If you refer oure will to outewarde workes, to naturall iudgement, there ſemeth a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne fredome: but if you refer oure wyll to the affections, there is no libertie euen by the iudgement of nature. At the laſt he concludeth: Thou ſeeſt, Reader, that I haue wrytten more playnely of free wyll, then ether Bernard, or any Scole men.</p>
            <p>And in his annotations vpon S. Paule to the Romanes, expoundyng that place of Paule, according to the predeſtination of God, after that he hath confirmed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is no caſualtye in thinges, nor libertye of wyll, he ſaythe thus at the lengthe: We teache, that God dothe not only ſuffer his creatures to worke, but that he him ſelffe properly dothe all thinges: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euen as they graunte y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vocation of Paule to haue bene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> proper worke of God, ſo let them graunt that all thoſe be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> proper workes of God, whether they be meanes, as eatyng and

drinkyng, which be common to men and beaſtes: or whether they be euell, as the adultery of Dauid, the ſeueritye of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius in kylling his ſonne: ſeing, it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that God dothe all thinges not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, but <hi>potenter,</hi> as Saynte Auguſtyne his worde is, that is, mightely working, ſo that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> traytery of Iudas is as well his proper worke, as the vocation of <hi>S.</hi> Paule.

He is not farre from placing hym aboue Paule, but certaynely he giueth hym the chayre next

For he cauſed bothe of them to be afterwarde prynted, ſcraping oute many thinges, adding, chaunging, correcting, in ſo muche that the laſte bokes were almoſt nothing lyke the fyrſt.

He ſayth that there be twentie diuerſe opinions of Melancthon concernyng this one artcle, and he reciteth fouretene ſundrie opinions of his ſcollers, in that boke which he dyd wryte agaynſt one Niericorar. For (ſaythe he) ſo ſone as they ſpied one place of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in the which there was any mention of Iuſtice, by &amp; by of it, they made a newe Iuſtice. For an example, one did reade, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham beleued, &amp; it was imputed to hym for ryghteouſnes: by and by he gathered oute of this one place .ij. kyndes of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, one of this worde, beleued: ſo that he ſayde, that faythe was oure Iuſtice, an other of the worde, was imputed, ſo that he ſayde that God dyd impute his iuſtice to vs, to accoumpt vs iuſte all thoughe we were not, and that this was oure ryghte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes.

An other did rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de: he dyd ryſe agayne for oure iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the Reſurrection ſayth he of Chriſt, is oure iuſtification. An other dyd reade, the holy ghoſt ſhall reproue the worlde for iuſtice, becauſe I go to my father, he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by and by, that the goyng of Chriſt to his father, is oure iuſtice. An other dyd reade: that we be made ryghteouſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute deſertes by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grace of God, he doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not to holde that the grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye of God, was oure iuſtice.

Other, that God receaueth vs to euerlaſting lyffe: other, that the meritte of Chriſt: other ſpeake of an other certayne meane ryghteouſnes, but they can not tell what it meaneth.

<pb facs="tcp:13954:95"/>
that none receaued the confeſſion of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſta, but the churches of Saxonie.

ſeing euery one of them had this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of hymſelffe, that they had profyted more in the ſtudy of holy ſcripture, then Philip had done: &amp; therefore eche of them thought hym ſelffe to be as able as he, to wryte a peculiar confeſſion of his faythe.

<pb facs="tcp:13954:99"/>
ſhall I ſay, how vnſhamefaſt or how wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked a rayler and rybalde Brentius is. He thinketh ſcorne to call him by his ſurna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me a Soto, but in deſpite he nyck nameth hym Aſotus.

But what manner a man dyd Brentius ſlaunder, when agaynſte all ryght &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience he dyd call hym Aſotus? Surely a man as Godly as euer ſucked a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s breſte in oure dayes, whiche not onlye in wordes, but alſo in dede hathe long ſynce forſaken the worlde, and that he myght haue more leaſure to leade his lyfe in god lynes, following the rule of Saynte Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minick, became one of his order many yea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>res agone, applying hym ſelffe to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, then to the ſtudie of holy ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. Whoſe doctrine and lyffe very ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly and purely ledd, was ſo much ſpo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken of of all men, that before all other y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſte Chriſtian Emperour Charles the fift dyd choſe hym to be his Confeſſor, to whome he wold reuele the priuie prickes of his conſciens, of whome he wolde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:13954:99"/>
ſouerayne ſalues of the ſame ſores, and by whoſe meanes he hoped to obtayne remiſſion of his ſynnes. For moſte mygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Princes are wonte to prefer none other to that office, but thoſe whiche be highely commended for theire excellent learning, and holynes of lyfe. And that you may more perceaue, that the Emperoure was nothing deceaued in hym, among many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he gaue this outewarde profe of his inwarde perfection, that when a Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryke was wyllingly offred hym, he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, and rather dyd choſe a pore kynde of lyuing, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which he myght paſſe ouer the reſt of the race of his lyfe, which was behynde.

Is this any thyng ells, but to call lyght darcknes, and darcknes lyght?
